Today I go through [the video](https://v.douyin.com/2JQsCoN/) from Jay Shetty。

Today's words

be wired for 天生的 

wire 是线的意思，wire up 就是把这个电器整起来，支棱起来。比如，wire up the PC, 就是把这个电脑整起来。 We're wired for something 意思就是我们天生就……

be educated for 教育成什么样子 他这个用法显示出了两个分化。 

we're wired for generosity, but we're educated for greed. 我们天生很慷慨，但是我们被教育的变贪婪。

known within one's heart 心知肚明，心里明白

would rather do something, 更愿意干一件事情

old tale / fable 寓言，古老的故事

extend oneself, 更努力一点，做出更多一点的努力

make an impact 产生影响

We're wired for generosity, but we're educated for greed.

And so, We're wired that way.

We know within our hearts that we'd rather help someone.

I mean, the science shows it today too.

People who help other people are happier.

This isn't just a old tale or fable or idea.

Right.

And so if we can extend ourselves, even a tiny bit, it can have a huge impact.

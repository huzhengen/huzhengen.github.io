I watched a video from Kevin Gates.

It's a hurting feeling when you're in a room full of people and you feel alone. 

It's a hurting feeling when you're around society, when you speak, nobody really understands you. 

Cuz they're so caught up in the social media, they're so caught up in reality television. 

It's difficult being around individuals when that's what they really care about. 

I don't care about that.

a room full of people 一屋子的人

feel alone 感到孤独， 这是一个固定搭配，字面上是一个错误的语法，因为应该是 feel lonely. He is alone, he feels lonely. 但是feel alone后来变成了固定搭配，就也是可以的。

social media 社交媒体，微博朋友圈之类的

reality television 真人秀，国内的这种好像不是很多，类似于黄金单身汉那种节目

individual 个人，individuals 这个时候可以跟 people 互换，就显得很高级。

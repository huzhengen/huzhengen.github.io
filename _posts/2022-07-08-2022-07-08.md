Today when i am working with Vue.js, i used the props data from the parent component.

The tips of webstorm showed that `ESLint: Unexpected mutation of "formData" prop.(vue/no-mutating-props)`.

I don't konw how to solve it, and i searched it on Google.

I found an answer, and i solve it.

I open the [汉兜](https://handle.antfu.me/), and want to guess today's idiom.

The prompt shows the chinese character 丝, and i guess the idiom is 丝丝入扣, but i failed.

I can't remember any idioms.

I went to google.com and search the idiom included 丝.

The second idiom i guessed is 抽丝剥茧, but i failed again.

I knew the finals of the first word is `ou`, and the finals of the last word is `ian`.

After i googled, i guess the idom is 藕断丝连.

I successed.

Today's words:

extremely 非常 极其 极端

idiom 成语

prompt 提示 付款期限

Chinese character 汉字

finals 韵母

kinda kind of 有点
